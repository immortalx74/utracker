## uTracker

uTracker is a tiny, tracker-like music authoring application. It's not meant as an alternative or replacement of any of the fine trackers out there (OpenMPT, ScreamTracker ImpulseTracker, etc.). It's simply a little coding project, which just mimics the very basic functionality and workflow of  what is considered to be a tracker.
#### For Beginners: What's a music tracker?
It's a music authoring tool which is based on playing-back sound samples at specified intervals. It's visualized as a grid (called the ***pattern editor***), with rows representing a time unit, and columns (called ***tracks*** or ***channels***) used to "stack" several samples together.
The grid is usually split by the user into several arrangements called ***patterns***. The whole collection of patterns is the complete song (called a ***module***). Unlike other music authoring tools, the patterns are arranged and scrolled vertically.
The most basic functionality of a tracker, is the ability to playback a sample at a different frequency, thus producing different musical notes. That means that the resulting file size is orders of magnitude smaller than recorded audio, and was the main reason of the widespread use of trackers through the 80's and 90's.
Although nowadays the drop in prices of audio hardware with pro features, in combination with affordable (or even free) DAW software is the preferred method of producing music at home, hardcore enthusiasts and pros alike still use trackers for music production, as it's the most immediate way to be creative.
