uTracker is a tiny, tracker-like music authoring application. It's not meant as an alternative or replacement of any of the fine trackers out there (OpenMPT, ScreamTracker ImpulseTracker, etc.). It's simply a little coding project, which just mimics the very basic functionality and workflow of what is considered to be a tracker.

#### For Beginners: What's a music tracker?

It's a music authoring tool which is based on playing-back sound samples at specified intervals. It's visualized in a grid (called a _**pattern **_), with rows representing the smallest time interval, and columns (called _**tracks**_ or _**channels**_) which are used to "stack" several samples together. Several patterns can e created to make a complete song (or in tracker-terms, a **module**). Unlike other music authoring tools, the patterns are arranged and scrolled vertically.

The most basic functionality of a tracker, is the ability to playback a sample at a different frequency, thus producing different musical notes. That means that the resulting file size is orders of magnitude smaller than recorded audio, and was the main reason of the widespread use of trackers through the 80's and 90's.

Although nowadays the drop in prices of audio hardware with pro features, in combination with affordable (or even free) DAW software is the preferred method of producing music at home, hardcore enthusiasts and pros alike still use trackers for music production, as it's the most immediate way to be creative.

#### Quick Guide:

The uTracker window is split in 3 panels:

-   Left Panel
    The 3 stacked lists host the Patterns, Instruments and Samples, respectively.
       - Patterns list
Use the patterns list buttons to add, remove, move up/down patterns, and access the current pattern's options. At the options window you can change the current pattern's name, and add/delete rows. 
    > Note: If there's existing data on deleted rows, it too gets deleted.
       - Instruments list
Use the instruments list buttons to add, remove, move up/down instruments, and access the current instrument's options. At the options window you can change the current instrument's name and edit its sample-map.
